    const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}`
        },
        body: formData
    });
    
    return await response.json();
}
```

### GPT-4 Analysis Integration
```javascript
async function analyzeWithGPT4(transcription, customInstructions) {
    const prompt = `
        Analyze this meeting transcription and generate professional minutes:
        ${customInstructions ? `Focus on: ${customInstructions}` : ''}
        
        Transcription: ${transcription}
